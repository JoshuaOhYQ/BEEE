# Instrument Types and Performance Characteristics

## Active and passive instruments
| Passive Instruments     | Active Instruments     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Output produced **entirely by the quantity being measured** (eg. fluid pressure) | Quantity being measured **modulates the magnitude of an external power source** to produce the output (eg. changes in resistance of strain gauge modulates external voltage) |
| Do not require an external power source to generate output | Rely on external power for their operation (usually in electrical form) |
| **Passive pressure gauge** measures fluid pressure by converting it directly into mechanical movement of a pointer (energy moving pointer comes entirely from pressure change in fluid) | **Float-type petrol tank level indicator** has a float that moves with petrol level and linked to a potentiometer arm which devides an external voltage producing output signal proportional to fuel level (energy from external source & float modulates it) |

## Null-Type and Deflection-Type
- **Deflection-Type Instruments**: The measured quantity causes a physical displacement (deflection) of a pointer or sensor which is directly proportional to the input.

- **Null-Type Instruments**: The measured quantity is balanced by a known reference force/input until equilibrium (*Null Point*) is achieved, hence no net deflection occurs at measurement.
