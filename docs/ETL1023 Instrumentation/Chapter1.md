# Introduction

## Measurement and Detection
- **Measurement** is a system that measures physical parameters that can be converted into recordable or comprehensible form of information. 

- **Measurement** applies to that span in ranges (for example: water level, pressure, temperature, etc.)

- **Detection** is a system that detects physical paramters in discrete (two-level) forms (for example: temperature switches, object presence which will give output of True or False, Hot or Cold, etc.)

## Instruments
- **Transducer** is a device that converts one type of energy to another type for various purposes (measurement or information transfer)

- **Transducers** has different types such as mechanical, electrical, optical, magnetic, etc.

- **Sensors** are a specialized transducer that converts a physical parameter (eg. temperature, light, etc.) into usually an electrical signal for measurement.

- There are different types of **sensors**, such as motion detectors, magnetic, laser, motion, infrared, airflow, etc.

- **Sensors** are transducers, but not all tranducers are sensors (loudspeaker converts electromagnetic energy to mechanical vibration, but it does not measure something, hence it is not a sensor) 

!!! warning 

    Only transducers that are used for measurement qualify as sensors


## Instrumentation 
- Instrumentation system is a collection engineering system that is used to measure, detect, record, display/indicate and control process parameters that occur in a manufacturing or processing applications. 

!!! tip "For Your Information"

    Key components of instrumentation system:

    - Sensors/Transducers: Convert physical parameters into measurable signals (for example: thermocouples, pressure sensors)

    - Signal Conditioners: Amplify or filter raw signals into clean, standardized form suitable for further processing (for example: analog-to-digital converters)

    - Controllers: Process data and send control commands (for example: PLCs, PID controllers)

    - Actuators: Execute control actions (for example: valves, motors)

    - Human-Machine Interface (HMI): Display data and allow user input


## Control
- **Automatic Control System** is important for **hardware automation**. 

- A typical mechatronic system that uses the theory of **hardware automation** looks like:

!!! tip "Raw signal suffer from:"

    - Low amplitude (e.g., microvolts from a thermocouple)

    - Noise/interference (e.g., electromagnetic interference in industrial environments)

    - Non-linearity (e.g., resistance-temperature curves in RTDs)

    - Impedance mismatch (e.g., high-output impedance of piezoelectric sensors)
