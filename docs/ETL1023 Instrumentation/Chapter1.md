# Introduction

## Measurement and Detection
- **Measurement** is a system that measures physical parameters that can be converted into recordable or comprehensible form of information. 

- **Measurement** applies to that span in ranges (for example: water level, pressure, temperature, etc.)

- **Detection** is a system that detects physical paramters in discrete (two-level) forms (for example: temperature switches, object presence which will give output of True or False, Hot or Cold, etc.)
