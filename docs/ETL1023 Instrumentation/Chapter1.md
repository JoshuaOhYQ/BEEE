# Introduction

## Measurement and Detection
- **Measurement** is a system that measures physical parameters that can be converted into recordable or comprehensible form of information. 

- **Measurement** applies to that span in ranges (for example: water level, pressure, temperature, etc.)

- **Detection** is a system that detects physical paramters in discrete (two-level) forms (for example: temperature switches, object presence which will give output of True or False, Hot or Cold, etc.)

## Instruments
- **Transducer** is a device that converts one type of energy to another type for various purposes (measurement or information transfer)

- **Transducers** has different types such as mechanical, electrical, optical, magnetic, etc.

- **Sensors** are a specialized transducer that converts a physical parameter (eg. temperature, light, etc.) into usually an electrical signal for measurement.

- There are different types of **sensors**, such as motion detectors, magnetic, laser, motion, infrared, airflow, etc.

- **Sensors** are transducers, but not all tranducers are sensors (loudspeaker converts electromagnetic energy to mechanical vibration, but it does not measure something, hence it is not a sensor) 

!!! warning 

    Only transducers that are used for measurement qualify as sensors
